# Introduction

This project is a Python-based Pharmacy Inventory Management System that allows users to manage a pharmacy's inventory. It involves creating a database and a table using MySQL, and includes functionalities to show, search, add, remove, and update inventory items. The code connects to a MySQL database and performs operations such as creating a database and table if they don't already exist, and providing a main menu with options for various inventory management tasks.
